# hello 🙌🏼 i'm raz

I´m a systems engineer with experience as a secure engineer and web development. I have spent the last three and a half years as security reviewer consultant for a life insurance company. I usually use GitHub to store documentation I made for the CTF and boxes I solve. 

🔏  I’m interested in all things infosec from GRC, pentesting and privacy.
🌱  I’m currently pursing a certification (OSCP or something in the likes) and also a master degree @ UNAM.
🎳  I’m looking to network through workshops, creating walkthroughs, etc.
👨🏻‍🏫  Always happy to help others sharing, and socializing knowledge with people.
☕️  Available to get coffee!
